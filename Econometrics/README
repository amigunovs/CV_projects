Here is a task requiring to perform an econometrical analysis of time-series data.
At first the code was written in Stata, but afterwards I decided to rewrite it in R to improve my skills in this language.
Although the techniques are not entirely the same, both approaches deliver their goal.



The Stata files contain the log and do files in txt and stata format, the data and files with the analysis and comments
Before running the code, the user should change the paths

The R code consists of 2 parts (separate files).
The data file should be run first because the file with the analysis uses it as a source. The paths should be changed as well
