*** DATA AND APPROACH ***

The data consists of 4 variables: price index in the euro area, price index in Latvia, Latvian export and euro area import (internal + external).
Period: from 01-1999 to 12-2019, dt = 1 month

Applied techniques: seasonal adjustment, ADF test, AR models, cointegration, Newey-West HAC, information criteria
Applied libraries (for R): eurostat, tidyr, dplyr, seasonal, ggplot2, ggfortify, urca, forecast, dynlm, stargazer


*** REMARKS ***

The Stata files contain the log and do files in txt and stata format, the data and files with the analysis and comments.
Before running the code, the user should change the paths.

The R code consists of 2 parts (separate files).
The data file should be run first because the file with the analysis uses it as a source. The paths should be changed as well.
My comments are inside.


*** BACKGROUND ***

This task required to perform an econometrical analysis of time-series data.
At first the code was written in Stata, but afterwards I decided to rewrite it in R to improve my skills in this language.
Although the techniques are not entirely the same, both approaches deliver their goal.
