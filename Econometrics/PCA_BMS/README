*** DATA AND APPROACH ***

The data is created from the European Commission survey data about life in different European cities, GDP in those cities, population data and is already prepared for the analysis 
(The observations with missing dependent variables are removed and the data is reshaped the way it can be analyzed in R).
The script performs principal component analysis to construct several factors (indices) that  might influence the GDP growth rate in the cities. Other factors are added separately.
After the PCA, several OLS regressions are added just to demonstrate high sensitivity of the models (different specifications give different significance levels for the same factors).
Thus, the BMA model is used to find factors which tests all possible combinations with specified factors and shows the factors that are and are not significant in most cases.

This was one of the recent tasks in the University of Latvia which was done in teams
