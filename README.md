Description of files
Econometrics - 2 files with R code replicate the same analysis as in stata. The first file contains code to download the data from Eurostat, the second file contains the analysis of the downloaded time-series data. The analysis consists of stationarity checks, building autoregressive, ADL and models with cointegration.
