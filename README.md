# CV_projects
This repository is created to show the programming topics I am familiar with. Thank you for the interest, I would really appreciate your feedback!

Description files of my projects are inside the folders

Currently, there are examples of:
* Time-series econometrical analysis of export data (map Econometrics) which includes stationarity tests, AR, ADL and cointegration models (the code was initially written in Stata and then replicated in R)
* Data parser which takes information on flats from ss.lv and tries to find the undervalued flats for sale (uses the ML technique)
* Data parser that allows to get information from a PDF file in excel format (in two ways)
* Other smaller projects that I used as instruments at work

As I mainly have been working with data analysis, many of my code files repeat themselves. Since the repository is supposed to contain only unique topics, I decided to exclude files that have similar code. All in all, these are only the examples.
