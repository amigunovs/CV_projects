*** DESCRIPTION *** 

The script takes country codes, searches for the eurostat quarterly data on the debt level and population and builds a few plots with ggplot2 package that show:
* The debt level per capita and its change compared to the previous quarter by European country
* The debt level as % of GDP and its changes in percentage points compared to the previous quarter by European country

Afterwards the script saves the plots in a new PDF file.

Note: data on population is published yearly while the debt data is available with quarterly frequency. For simplicity I take the latest debt data and divide it by the latest  population data without any adjustment (even though the population data changes during the year)
